Ur making me a website for a fake flower shop. Create a navbar by typing nav and hitting tab inside the body. In the navbar have two links "Home", "Flowers". Use the image called logo.png for the brand. Make it look nice. Dont use the default grey colors. Use the master.css to do all of ur css. If u need help with referencing the elements to change their styles ill help u. Look at other navbars on other websites for inspiration. Learning SASS will make this much easier in terms of styling things so learn that it literally took me 5 minutes of reading and i knew how to use it. https://sass-lang.com/guide Specifically the nesting, partials, and variables.
